# ENC Client: Secure Remote Access

The **ENC Client** (`enc-cli`) is your secure gateway. It empowers you to access your encrypted projects from anywhere and manages your secure workflow sessions.

## 🌍 Feature 3: Access from Anywhere
Whether you are on a laptop in a cafe or a workstation at home, `enc-cli` connects you securely to your project server.

- **Secure Session Management**:
    - **Login**: Establishes a secure tunnel and unlocks your keys in memory.
    - **Work**: Run commands, edit files, and execute code remotely.
    - **Logout**: Instantly wipes local keys and locks the remote session.

- **Auto-Locking**:
    - Closing your terminal or internet disconnection automatically triggers a session lock, ensuring no unattended access.

## 🔄 Smart Git Synchronization (Beta)
ENC integrates deeply with your workflow to ensure specific version control safety.

When you finish a session (Logout/Close):
1.  **Auto-Commit**: ENC detects changes in your workspace.
2.  **Flexible Modes**:
    *   **Encrypted Mode**: Commits encrypted blobs to public/untrusted repos (safe coding on GitHub).
    *   **Decrypted Mode**: Commits plaintext to internal secure/self-hosted GitLabs.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Install
```bash
cd enc-cli
./install.sh
```

### 2. Configure
Point the CLI to your ENC Server.
```bash
enc config init
# URL: http://your-server-ip:2222
# User: your-username
# SSH Key: [Leave empty if using ssh-agent/ssh-add]
```

### 3. SSH Setup (Important)
Ensure your SSH agent is running and has your ENC key loaded so the CLI can connect without password prompts.
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/enc_key


#### Alternative: Manual Configuration
If you prefer not to use an agent or config file, you can explicitly tell ENC which key to use:
```bash
enc set-ssh-key ~/.ssh/enc_key
```

### 4. Login
Start your secure session.
```bash
enc login
```
