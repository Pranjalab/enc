Collaboration
=============

Join us in building the most secure coding environment for developers.

Our Story
---------

ENC was born out of a personal necessity. As a developer working on sensitive **trading algorithms** and **production automation scripts**, I realized that deploying code to a standard VPS or cloud server meant exposing my intellectual property to anyone with root access or physical disk access.

Existing solutions were either too complex (full disk encryption requiring remote unlock) or too cumbersome (manual GPG encryption). I wanted a solution that felt like a local folder but was physically secure on the remote end.

Thus, ENC (Encrypted Coding) was built—a tool to scratch my own itch, now open-sourced for the community.

How to Contribute
-----------------

We welcome contributions from security enthusiasts, Go/Python developers, and anyone passionate about privacy.
